# AdventOfCode22
Taking this christmas to learn Rust :D
Please forgive the messy code. I lose the motivation to clean up after myself after solving the puzzle :P

# Common library Bugs
1. For the aoc_common FileContents::build, account for newline-terminated input.

# Comments on each day

## Day 1
Not challenging, but this being my first puzzle to solve in Rust, it was kind of painful to wrestle with the borrow checker, hope this improves over time

## Day 2

## Day 3

## Day 4

## Day 5

## Day 6

## Day 7
Day 7 was much more challenging. Im pretty sure there is a better way to solve the puzzle without having to construct an actual file directory system you could crawl through. Nevertheless, I did it to practice using smart pointers :)

## Day 8 
Having some experience with robotics costmap helps with thinking about how to represent and store the forest height map. It was a good challenge :) Just had to make sure I read the rules properly about which trees could or could not be seen.

## Day 9
TODO: Add uncrustify as a linting tool
Solved part 1 but didn't manage to solve part 2.

## Day 10
