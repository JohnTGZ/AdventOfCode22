# AdventOfCode22
Taking this christmas to learn Rust :D
Please forgive the messy code. I lose the motivation to clean up after myself after solving the puzzle :P

# Common library Bugs
1. For the aoc_common FileContents::build, account for newline-terminated input.

## Day 1

## Day 2

## Day 3

## Day 4

## Day 5

## Day 6

## Day 7
Day 7 was much more challenging. Im pretty sure there is a better way to solve the puzzle without having to construct an actual file directory system you could crawl through. Nevertheless, I did it to practice using smart pointers :)

## Day 8 
Having some experience with robotics costmap helps with thinking about how to represent and store the forest height map.
